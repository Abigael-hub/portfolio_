      About Me
    </h2>

    <!-- INTRO -->
    <div class="space-y-6 text-lg leading-relaxed">
      <p>
        I am a Monitoring, Evaluation, and Research Consultant with over seven years of experience designing and delivering rigorous studies that inform program strategy, accountability, and funding decisions across East Africa. My work focuses on generating credible evidence that helps organizations understand what works, why it works, and how to improve outcomes for the communities they serve.
      </p>

      <p>
        I have worked with leading global consultancies, including <strong>:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}</strong> and <strong>:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}</strong>, as well as international NGOs, foundations, and research organizations implementing complex social programs. Through these engagements, I have led and contributed to large-scale evaluations, longitudinal studies, and mixed-methods research across diverse sectors and contexts.
      </p>

      <p>
        My technical expertise spans the full evaluation cycle — from study design and methodology development to data collection oversight, statistical analysis, and dissemination of findings. I specialize in baseline, midline, endline, and impact evaluations, as well as longitudinal and quasi-experimental designs that produce robust and defensible evidence. My approach integrates quantitative and qualitative methods to capture both measurable outcomes and contextual insights, ensuring that recommendations are grounded in real program realities.
